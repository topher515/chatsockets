Start the Node server with `NODE_PATH=. node chat.js`. 

The `NODE_PATH=.` shenanigans are so node looks in the current
directory for the `socket.io` module.

The default is for the server to start at 'localhost:8030'.

Then open the `chat.html` in a webbrowser; the Javascript on 
`chat.html` attempts to open connections to the `chat.js`
server at 'localhost:8030'.
